## Plan
Blogs, tutorials, and explanations on Google illustrate that planning is the most crucial step in vibe coding. So, I turned my GitHub dashboard into a Vibe Code. Next, craft your language statements to include the framework of your design and follow existing libraries and elements. Then end with the statement, "Please output the steps we need to go through to build the site." (Coxon, D.)

Language example:
I will work to code a component-based website for my bioinformatics dashboard. I will be using d3.js, app.js, sample.json, and index.html. Please output the steps we need to go through in order to build the site.

## Project management
Create a directory tree of data, src, modules, and system dependencies. Work on directories and look for dependencies.
 
Language example:
I will create parent directories. I will be inside the parent directory creating d3.js to display sample.json. 

## Output code
Run the LL in LLM like Gemini AI. (2025). Gemini (June 2025) [Large language model]. https://gemini.google.com/ 

## Debugging
Debug the code and test.
